# Applications

This directory contains the core application services of the project.  
It consists of **two containerised microservices**:

- **Frontend**: A React single-page application acting as the homepage and UI
- **Backend**: A Node.js (Express) authentication service connected to persistent storage

Both services are Dockerised, independently deployable, and designed for cloud-native environments.
